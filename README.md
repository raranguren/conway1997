This repo holds my 1997 project: an interactive [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for MS-DOS, made with Turbo Pascal and assembler. It was all about making the simulation run fast while letting users interact with it in real-time, drawing cells and watching them evolve.

I used Turbo Pascal for the structure and assembler for performance and dealing with graphics and mouse input. This combo let me push DOS to its limits, creating a Game of Life where you can see cells age in color and modify the board on the fly.

## Running It
This was made for old-school MS-DOS systems with VGA graphics and a mouse. Modern machines can't run it directly. You'll need a DOS emulator like DOSBox.

I've hosted an emulation using JS-DOS in GitHub pages:

## Why This Project
It was my way of diving deep into assembler and seeing how far I could optimize and enhance the experience of a classic simulation on hardware that, at the time, was already a decade old.

I was using an [Amstrad PC1512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC1512) with VGA graphics card and a mouse connected to the serial port.

## Why is the app in Spanish

Because I didn't speak English back then and wanted to keep the original as it is. The web version above has instructions in English, though.
